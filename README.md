# cplay2

## description

cplay is now back with some more features!
It is a fork of the well known cplay, I have desided to call it cplay2.

cplay is a curses front-end for various audio players. It aims
to provide a power-user-friendly interface with simple filelist
and playlist control. cplay is written in Python and can use
either pyncurses or the standard curses module.
